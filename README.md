# ISC Mining Prototype Extensions

This repository contains the implementation of an Instance Spanning Constraint (ISC) mining graphical user interface. The implementation of this application is built upon the fundamentals, principles and ISC discovery algorithms presented in the paper [Discovering instance and process spanning constraints from process execution logs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437919305368) and the paper [SVIPEX: A Web Service for Discovering and Visualizing Instance Spanning Constraints based on Process Execution Logs](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2673/paperDR11.pdf) as well the project found in the [ISC-Mining 2020 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WinterKaro/iscmining-infsys20).
